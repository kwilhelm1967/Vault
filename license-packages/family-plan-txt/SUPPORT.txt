### Installation & Activation

#### Multiple Device Activation

#### License Already Activated
- Each license key can only be used on one device
- If you're replacing a device, deactivate the old one first
- Contact priority support if you've lost access to the old device

### Cloud Sync Issues

#### Sync Not Working
- Verify internet connection on all devices
- Check that Cloud Sync is enabled in Settings
- Ensure you're using the same sync account on all devices
- Try signing out and back into your sync account

#### Sync Conflicts
- If multiple devices modified the same entry, a conflict may occur
- The app will prompt you to choose which version to keep
- You can also merge changes manually
- Regular syncing reduces the chance of conflicts

### Family Sharing

#### Can't See Shared Passwords
- Verify the password was shared with the correct email address
- Check that the recipient has accepted the sharing invitation
- Ensure both users have Cloud Sync enabled
- Try re-sharing the password

#### Sharing Permission Issues
- Verify the correct permission level was assigned (view-only or edit)
- The owner can modify permissions at any time
- Recipients cannot share passwords further unless given permission
- Contact priority support if permissions aren't working correctly

### Multi-Device Management

#### Device Limit Reached
- The Family Plan supports up to 3 devices
- Deactivate unused devices to free up licenses
- Consider upgrading to Business Plan for more devices

#### Deactivating Old Devices
