================================================================================

END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (EULA)

Last Updated: December 2024

BY INSTALLING OR USING LOCAL PASSWORD VAULT, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE 
TERMS OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT.

================================================================================
                              1. GRANT OF LICENSE
================================================================================

Local Password Vault grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, perpetual 
license to use the Software on up to FIVE (5) devices within a single 
household, subject to the terms of this Agreement.

This is a LIFETIME LICENSE. Once purchased, you may use the software 
indefinitely on the licensed devices without additional payments.

The Family Plan includes five (5) unique license keys. Each key may be used 
on one device only.

================================================================================
                              2. FAMILY DEFINITION
================================================================================

"Family" is defined as individuals residing in the same household. This 
includes:
- Spouse/Partner
- Children
- Parents
- Siblings
- Other relatives living in the same home

The Family Plan is NOT intended for:
- Business use
- Friends living elsewhere
- Multiple households

================================================================================
                              3. PERMITTED USES
================================================================================

You MAY:
- Install the Software on up to five (5) devices in one household
- Assign one license key to each family member
- Create encrypted backups of each vault
- Export data in supported formats
- Receive free software updates
- Transfer a license to a new device (deactivating the old one first)
  * Transfer limit: Up to 3 transfers per year per license key
  * Each transfer requires internet connection for validation
  * If you exceed the limit, contact support for assistance

================================================================================
                              4. RESTRICTIONS
================================================================================

You MAY NOT:
- Share license keys outside your household
- Use one key on multiple devices
- Share keys with friends or extended family not in your home
- Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software
- Sell, rent, lease, or sublicense the Software
- Use the Software for commercial purposes
- Remove any proprietary notices or labels

================================================================================
                              5. DATA PRIVACY
================================================================================

Local Password Vault:
- Stores ALL data locally on each device only
- Does NOT sync data between family members' devices
- Does NOT transmit any data to external servers
- Does NOT have access to any family member's passwords
- Cannot recover data if a master password is lost

Each family member is solely responsible for:
- Remembering their own master password
- Creating and maintaining their own backups
- Securing their own device

================================================================================
                              6. INDEPENDENT VAULTS
================================================================================

Each family member's vault is completely independent:
- Separate encryption keys
- Separate master passwords
- No data sharing between vaults
- No synchronization between devices

This design ensures maximum privacy for each family member.

================================================================================
                              7. NO WARRANTY
================================================================================

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR 
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

================================================================================
                              8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
================================================================================

IN NO EVENT SHALL LOCAL PASSWORD VAULT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION 
WITH THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE.

Because all data is stored locally and we have no access to it, we cannot be 
held responsible for data loss due to:
- Forgotten master passwords
- Device failure or theft
- Failure to maintain backups
- User error

================================================================================
                              9. UPDATES
================================================================================

included in your lifetime license at no additional cost for all five devices.

================================================================================
                              10. TERMINATION
================================================================================

This license is effective until terminated. It will terminate automatically if 
you fail to comply with any term of this Agreement. Upon termination, you must 
destroy all copies of the Software on all devices.

================================================================================
                              11. GOVERNING LAW
================================================================================

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws 
of the United States of America.

================================================================================
                              12. ENTIRE AGREEMENT

Agreement, understand it, and agree to be bound by its terms.
