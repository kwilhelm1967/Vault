TO START BOTH APPS AT THE SAME TIME:

Run this command in your terminal:

  npm run dev:both

This starts:
  - Password Vault on http://localhost:5173
  - Legacy Vault on http://localhost:5174

Then open both URLs in your browser to see two different products.

FILE CHANGED: src/components/LicenseScreen.tsx
- Port 5173 = Password Vault (isLLV = false)
- Port 5174 = Legacy Vault (isLLV = true)
- Removed all other detection logic - port is the ONLY factor
