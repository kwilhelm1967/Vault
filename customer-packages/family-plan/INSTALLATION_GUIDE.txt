## Multi-Device Best Practices

### Security Recommendations

1. **Unique Master Passwords**
   - Use different master passwords on each device
   - This prevents one compromise affecting all devices

2. **Regular Backups**
   - Export vault data weekly
   - Store backups securely (encrypted USB, etc.)

3. **Consistent Categories**
   - Use the same category structure across devices
   - Makes organization easier

### Family Organization

1. **Shared vs. Personal Passwords**
   - **Shared:** WiFi, streaming services, family accounts
   - **Personal:** Individual email, banking, social media

2. **Age-Appropriate Access**
   - Consider what children should access
   - Use view-only permissions for sensitive accounts

3. **Regular Reviews**
   - Monthly family password review
   - Update shared passwords as needed
   - Remove access for unused accounts

## Troubleshooting Multi-Device Issues

### License Activation Problems

**"License already in use" error:**
- Each device needs a different license key
- Check you're using the correct key for each device
- Contact support if keys aren't working

**Can't activate on new device:**
- Verify you haven't exceeded 3 device limit
- Deactivate old devices: Settings → License → Deactivate
- Use the freed license key on new device

### Sharing Issues

**Can't connect devices for sharing:**
- Ensure devices are on same network
- Check firewall settings
- Try manual export/import instead

**Passwords not syncing:**
- Verify sharing is enabled on both devices
- Check network connectivity
- Re-generate sharing key if needed

### Data Sync Problems

**Import fails:**
- Check file format (should be .csv or .json)
- Verify file isn't corrupted
- Try exporting again from source device

**Duplicate passwords after import:**
- Review import options
- Choose "merge" instead of "replace"
- Manually clean up duplicates
