# GitHub Download URL Issue - Need Exact URL

## 🔍 Problem

Download URL returns 404 even though file exists on GitHub.

## ✅ Solution

Need the exact URL from GitHub. Easiest way:

### Get Exact URL from GitHub

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/kwilhelm1967/Vault/releases
2. **Find the file:** `Local.Password.Vault.Setup.1.2.0.exe` (or whatever it's named)
3. **Right-click** on the filename
4. **Click:** "Copy link address"
5. **Share that URL** - I'll update the code to match it exactly

### Alternative: Check Release Details

**On the GitHub release page, check:**
- **Tag name:** What's shown at the top? (e.g., `v1.2.0`, `V1.2.0`, `1.2.0`)
- **Filename:** Click on the file to see the exact name

**Common issues:**
- Tag might be `1.2.0` (no 'v' prefix)
- Filename might have different spacing/formatting
- Release might be a draft (not published)

## 🔧 What We've Tried

- ✅ `V1.2.0` (capital V) - 404
- ✅ `v1.2.0` (lowercase v) - 404
- ✅ Filename: `Local.Password.Vault.Setup.1.2.0.exe`

**Still need the exact URL to match!**

**Once you share the exact URL, I'll update the code immediately!**
