# STRIPE PRODUCTS SETUP FOR ONE-TIME PURCHASES

## Your developer needs to create these EXACT products in Stripe Dashboard

### Go to Stripe Dashboard → Products → Create Product

PRODUCT 1: Single User License
Name: "Local Password Vault - Single User"
Description: "Single device license with complete source code"
Price: (one-time payment, NOT recurring)
Metadata:
  Key: product_id
  Value: prod_single_user

PRODUCT 2: Family Plan License  
Name: "Local Password Vault - Family Plan"
Description: "3 device licenses with family sharing"
Price:  (one-time payment, NOT recurring)
Metadata:
  Key: product_id

## IMPORTANT NOTES FOR YOUR DEVELOPER

1. These are ONE-TIME payments, NOT subscriptions
2. No trial period in Stripe (trial is built into the software)
3. Customer pays once and owns forever
4. The metadata product_id MUST match exactly what's in the webhook code

## WEBHOOK SETUP

Go to Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks → Add Endpoint

Endpoint URL: https://your-render-url.onrender.com/webhook/stripe

Events to send:
- checkout.session.completed (when customer completes purchase)

That's it! Only one webhook event needed for one-time purchases.
